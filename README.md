# Gasless Transactions

gm gm!!!

you have come a long way, minting your first NFT to staking it. Now it's time to improve the user experience which you and all end user deserves! And for this we will be using **Account Abstraction** through [Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/).

## What is Account Abstraction?

Account abstraction is a concept that allows users to interact with smart contracts without having to pay for gas. This is done by relayers who pay for the gas and then charge the user for the transaction. This is a very useful concept for dApps that want to provide a better user experience.

## What is Biconomy?

The Biconomy SDK provides solutions from onboarding to user engagement for a decentralised application (dApp) in a non-custodial way. It is a one-stop solution to enable an effortless experience in your dApp as it eases onboarding for new users and abstracts away transaction complexities that your users face on a daily basis. This is enabled using Smart Contract Wallets (SCW) built on top of our multi-chain Relayer Infrastructure.
